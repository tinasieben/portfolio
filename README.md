## Description

##### **Hori∙seo∙n Homepage** is the webpage-home of a marketing agency, ***Horiseon***, designed primarily to meet Web Accessiblity Initiative (WAI) Web Accessibility standards as set by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).

##### Web accessibility is becoming increasingly important for any business to consider to ensure inclusivity and maximize web traffic potential. Accomodating people with disabilities so that they can interact with a website always pays off: exhibiting consideration for others directly correlates to the expansion of potential reach.

##### Following the Scout Rule and aiming for long-term sustainability, the semantically and sequentially refactored codebase enables assistive technologies, like screen readers (text alternatives), so that the deployed homepage is accessible and fully functional.

***User Story***:

> AS A marketing agency ⇢ I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards ⇢ SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
